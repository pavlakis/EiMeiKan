                    <img src="img/morihei-ueshiba.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p>Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, was born on December 14, 1882. At first a sickly and weak child, his samurai father encouraged him to take up sumo wrestling, and swimming to improve his physique.</p>
                    <p>In Tokyo in 1901; he devoted himself to the study of Jujitsu and swordsmanship. He later served with distinction during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. While still fighting at the front, he worked on his physical strength, and built himself up to a rock-hard 170 pounds standing just five-foot one inch tall.</p>
                    <p>Preceding World War II, Morihei moved with his family to the wilderness of Hokkaido. Historically, the most significant event of his stay in Hokkaido was his meeting with Sokaku Takeda. Takeda was the grandmaster of Daito-Tyu Aiki-Jutsu and was a master swordsman. Morihei proved no match for Sokaku. Because of his respect for Sokaku, he built a dojo in Hokkaido and invited him to live and teach there.</p>

                    <h2>Etiquette</h2>
                    <h3>Entering The Training Hall</h3>
                    <p>Have your suit on and belt tied properly. Just inside the door, perform a bow towards the photograph of O Sensei. Go to the corner of the mat and perform a kneeling bow, again towards the photograph of O Sensei.</p>
                    <h3>The Bow</h3>
                    <p>Remain seated on your knees. Place the left hand on the mat in front of you, place the right hand next to it, so that the two thumbs and index fingers form a triangle.</p>
                    <h3>Starting Class</h3>
                    <p>When Sensei or appointed instructor enters the training hall all members should line up in the sitting position facing the photograph of O Sensei.</p>
                    <p>All bow with the Instructor toward the photograph of O Sensei, then return the Instructor´s bow, saying “onegaishimas” (please teach me). Follow the Instructor´s lead during the warming up exercises.</p>
                    <h3>During Class</h3>
                    <p>Perform a standing bow to your old and new partner. If the instructor should teach you and your partner individually, it is proper to perform a bow afterwards. Whilst the instructor is working with your partner, kneel on the mat.</p>
                    <p>Make sure that your training suit remains tied properly during practice and that you remain adequately covered.</p>
                    <h3>Coming Late To Class - Leaving Early</h3>
                    <p>Wait before entering or leaving the training hall until the instructor is not demonstrating. Wait at the side of the mat to ask permission to come onto the mat. Perform the proper kneeling bow. When leaving early go to the Instructor and ask permission to leave the class. Perform the proper kneeling bow before leaving the mat.</p>
                    <h3>At The End Of The Class</h3>
                    <p>When indicated by the Instructor, line up in a straight line, as at the start of the class. All bow with the Instructor toward the photograph of O Sensei, then return the instructors bow saying “domo arigato gozaimashita” (thank you for teaching me). Allow the Instructor to leave the tatami (mat) first. It is then polite to bow and thank your partners. Perform kneeling and standing bows in a similar manner to when entering the Dojo (training hall) but in reverse.</p>
                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>Zori (footwear) must be worn to and from the tatami (mat).</p>
                    <p>Wash your keikogi (training suit) at least once a week. Keep it in a good state of repair. Also, make sure that finger and toenails are short and long hair is tied back. Keep a high standard of personal hygiene.</p>
                    <p>Note that no jewellery of any kind should be worn in the Dojo. Wedding rings etc., which cannot be removed should be covered with adhesive plaster.</p>
                    <p>No eating or drinking is allowed the dojo, unless your Sensei has given you permission.</p>
